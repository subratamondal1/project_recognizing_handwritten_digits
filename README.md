# 📚 Project -- Recognizing Handwritten Digits 

## Introduction
We will build a Neural Network that can recognize handwritten numbers. To achieve this goal, we use **MNIST**, a database of handwritten digits made up of a training set of **60,000** examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. The training examples are annotated by humans with the correct answer. For instance, if the handwritten digit is the number “3,” then 3 is simply the label associated with that example.
* **`Supervised Learning ---`** a type of machine learning that uses labeled data to train a model that can classify data or predict outcomes.
* Each MNIST image is in grayscale and consists of 28 x 28 pixels.
