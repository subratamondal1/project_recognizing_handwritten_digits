        "We will build a Neural Network that can recognize handwritten numbers. To achieve this goal, we use **MNIST**, a database of handwritten digits made up of a training set of **60,000** examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. The training examples are annotated by humans with the correct answer. For instance, if the handwritten digit is the number ‚Äú3,‚Äù then 3 is simply the label associated with that example.\n",
        "* **`Supervised Learning ---`** a type of machine learning that uses labeled data to train a model that can classify data or predict outcomes.\n",
        "* Each MNIST image is in **grayscale** and consists of **28 x 28** pixels."
